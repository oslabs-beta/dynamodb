## Description

WatchTower is a robust visualization tool for user's Amazon DynamoDB capacity. Developers can often have difficulty analyzing and interpreting DynamoDB provisioning metrics due to the complexities of existing monitoring tools. WatchTower centralizes this data and allows users to generate metric data from DynamoDB usage and to visualize this data using our graphical UI. You can even ask for more input utilizing Amazon's Bedrock AI from within our application! Additionally, you can store and access this historical data and use this information to find usage patterns to form strategies on how to optimize and make your DynamoDB usage more efficient.

## Getting Started

Getting started with WatchTower is simple!

1. **Fork GitHub repo.**
2. **Clone the repo into VS Code.**
3. **Create a `.env` file <strong><u>in the server folder</u></strong> using below template**
    ```sh
    # AWS Credentials for Connecting AWS
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_aws_access_key_id"
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_aws_secret_access_key"
    REGION="your_aws_region"
    ```
4. **Navigate to your cloned repo and open a terminal. Run the following commands:**
   ```sh
   npm i
   npm start
   ```
 - If localhost:3000 does not automatically open in your browser, open this link: http://localhost:3000/
5. Sign Up: Create an account on our website, or login with GitHub.
6. Connect Your DynamoDB: Use our easy-to-follow guide to connect your DynamoDB tables to WatchTower.
   - Warning: If you use the AWS Account Info to update your AWS Key, you have to restart the application!
7. Generate metric data: Input necessary information, such as the table you wish to analyze and the time period you wish to see database metrics.
8. As simple as that, your metric data and visual data is generated!
9. Generate AI insight: Users can also generate insights from Amazon's Bedrock AI simply by pressing a button.
10. Save table metrics/graphs: Users can save their generated analysis and metric data to their DynamoDB database by clicking on the ‚Äúsave analysis‚Äù button.
11. Analyze Historical Data: Dive into historical metrics to identify trends and optimize performance by navigating over to the reports page.
    - AWS Bedrock has a lot of AI Model: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html Here is the list for the Model name and its ID. The model that we are using is ‚ÄòMistral 7B Instruct‚Äô.
    - AWS Bedrock is not free, they have distinct price for model. Here is the link for pricing: https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/?refid=ft_card
    - Not all model has responsesteram, if the model you want use dont have responsestream, you can use invokemodelcommand method! https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/client/bedrock-runtime/command/InvokeModelCommand/
    - In order to grant access for specific AI model, you have to https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/ and login, on the left side bar, choose Foundation models -> Base models and click whatever model you want. Inside the model Overview, there is a button ‚ÄòRequest model access‚Äô. Then you will be all set!
